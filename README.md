AliensReturn - AR Experience


Inspiration
We are all gamers and were inspired to bring back the feels of a classic arcade game. Since we have worked with VR before, we decided to add a twist by making this game an Augmented reality application. We also agreed on having a sci-fi theme and thought that an alien related theme would be best.

What it does
Our application enables you and up to 3 other friends to enjoy a co-op experience in AR on any mobile platform of your choice.

How we built it
Our application was built using Unity, Vuforia, and Photon Networking.

Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into was integrating the co-op/networking experience.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we were able to create an AR experience that is not only beautiful but is playable/compatible on several mobile platforms.

What we learned
We learned how to set up an AR experience using Unity and Vuforia as well as how to set up multiplayer networking through a dedicated server.

What's next for AliensReturnAR
A sequel embodying the entire scope of our game's world; all in VR.
